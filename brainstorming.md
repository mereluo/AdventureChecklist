## Step 1: Brainstorming - New App Ideas

### 1. Adventure Checklist (Travel)

An intelligent travel packing app that generates smart checklists based on your trip's duration, destination (domestic/international), season, number of travelers, and trip type (e.g., business, leisure, hiking). Supports customization, saving templates, and local weather sync.

### 2. Daily Boost (Health & Fitness / Lifestyle)

A mood-aware wellness tracker that recommends micro-activities (like stretches, hydration, breathing, or short walks) based on your current mood, time of day, and phone usage patterns. Includes daily gratitude journaling.

### 3. Focus Bubble (Productivity)

A minimal, gamified focus timer app that visualizes your progress with growing bubbles. Each focus session earns you “growth” and can sync with your calendar and task manager.

## Step 2.2: App Evaluation

✅ Adventure Checklist

- *Mobile*: Location services, local weather API, and offline checklist support make it distinctly mobile.
- *Story*: Solves a common frustration for travelers: forgetting essentials. Strong pitch for frequent travelers and families.
- *Market*: Large market: travel is a booming industry. Niche value to solo travelers, families, and business trippers.
- *Habit*: Moderate; users likely to use it before every trip. Could build habit via trip history, packing tips, and reusable lists.
- *Scope*: Clear MVP: generate a checklist from user input. Weather and user profile integration can be scoped for later iterations.

✅ Focus Bubble
- *Mobile*: Uses push notifications, timer sessions, local storage, and calendar/task manager integration—making it natively mobile.
- *Story*: Helps users visualize productivity and reduce distraction with a calming metaphor. Strong appeal for students and remote workers.
- *Market*: Focus and productivity apps have a large, evergreen market. This concept brings a unique visual spin.
- *Habit*: High potential; users will return daily for focus sessions. Gamification promotes habit retention.
- *Scope*: MVP can include timer, bubble animation, and calendar sync. Advanced features like analytics and focus streaks can follow later.

## Step 2.3: Final Decision ✅

Chosen App: **Adventure Checklist**
